# InterviewQuestions

Collection of job interview questions, currently only houses one code test which I took on May 9, 2019.

The **Questions** folder contains screen shots of all of the questions I was asked.  The test was broken up into 3 sections: 
1) 7 data analysis questions
  - This section was completed in a local notebook `ArundoCodeTest.ipynb`
  - The two data files that were provided are located in the AnalysisData folder
2) 3 coding challenge questions
  - This work was performed in the browswer code editor
  - My submitted answers are saved in the CodeChallengeAnswers folder as screenshots
3) 1 Free form essay question
  - I wrote this in the browser but saved it at the end of my notebook.
