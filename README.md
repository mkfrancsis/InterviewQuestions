# InterviewQuestions

Collection of job interview questions, currently only houses one code test which I took on May 9, 2019.  I cannot confirm that my submitted answers for section 1 are correct.  In section 2, my code for questions 1 & 2 passed all of the test cases, however, my code for question 3 only passed some of the test cases.

The [Questions](https://github.com/mkfrancsis/InterviewQuestions/tree/master/Questions) folder contains screen shots of all of the questions I was asked.  The test was broken up into 3 sections: 
1) 7 data analysis questions
  - This section was completed in a local notebook [ArundoCodeTest.ipynb](https://github.com/mkfrancsis/InterviewQuestions/blob/master/ArundoCodeTest.ipynb)
  - The two data files that were provided are located in the [AnalysisData folder](https://github.com/mkfrancsis/InterviewQuestions/tree/master/AnalysisData)
2) 3 coding challenge questions
  - This work was performed in the browser code editor
  - My submitted answers are saved in the [CodeChallengeAnswers](https://github.com/mkfrancsis/InterviewQuestions/tree/master/Questions/CodeChallengeAnswers) folder as screenshots
3) 1 Free form essay question
  - I wrote this in the browser but saved it at the end of my notebook.
